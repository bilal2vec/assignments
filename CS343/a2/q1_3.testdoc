# Checking for proper sorting of non-basic types

In our case we defined a `Point(x, y)` type and we will sort a list of points by their distance from `(0, 0)`

To run this, set `TYPE:=Point` in `Makefile` and run `make`

Our points are (1, 1), (3, 3), (0, 3), and (-1, 2)

```bash
$ cat q1_3.txt
4 1 1 3 3 0 3 -1 2
$ ./binsertsort q1_3.txt
(1,1) (3,3) (0,3) (-1,2)
(1,1) (-1,2) (0,3) (3,3)

$
```
