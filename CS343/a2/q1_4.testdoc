$ Testing for lists of zero or one element

1. Test for empty list (zero elements)
2. Test for list of one element

```bash
$ cat q1_4.txt
0
1 42
$ ./bininsertsort q1_4.txt



42
42

$
```
As there are no elements in the first list, the program prints only newlines The second list has one element, so it is printed as is.
