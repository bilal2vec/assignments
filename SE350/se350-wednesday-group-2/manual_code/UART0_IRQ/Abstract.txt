The UART0_irq program is to demonstrate how to program uart0 interrupts. The uart1 is by polling for debugging purpose.
The UART0_irq program is available in different targets:

 - UART0 IRQ SIM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Configured for simulator debugger

 - UART0 IRQ RAM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Runs from Internal RAM located on chip
     (may be used for target debugging)

Expected behavior: 
On UART1: it will print a line "COM1> Type a character at COM0 terminal". If DEBUG_0 is defined, more debugging messsages will appear during run time.
On UART0: user presses a key on the keyboard, then the key will be echoed back to UART0 as "You Typed a "<key_typed>. 
For Example, assume "d" is pressed on the keyboard, UART0 will display "You Typed a d".
