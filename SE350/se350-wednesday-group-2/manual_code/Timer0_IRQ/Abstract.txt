The Timer0_IRQ program is to demonstrate how to program timer0 interrupt.
The Timer0_IRQ program is available in different targets:

 - Timer IRQ SIM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Configured for simulator debugger

 - Timer IRQ RAM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Runs from Internal RAM located on chip
     (may be used for target debugging)

Expected behavior: 
Prints to COM1 0-9, one digit a time every second by polling. The program loops around when 9 is reached.
