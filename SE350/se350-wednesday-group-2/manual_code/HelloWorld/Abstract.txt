The HelloWorld project is a simple example to output strings to serial ports by polling
for the NXP 'LPC1768' microcontroller using Keil 'MCB1700' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - UART0 outputs "Howdy!" by polling
 - UART1 outputs "HelloWorld" by polling

The HelloWorld program is available in different targets:

 - HelloWorld SIM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Configured for simulator debugger
   
 - HelloWorld RAM:
   - Compiler:                  ARM Compiler Default Version 5
   - Runs from Internal RAM located on chip
     (may be used for target debugging)
